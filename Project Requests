1. Please download the historical prices and dates of gold and silver from these 2 URLs (Jan 2019 till now):

 

•             https://www.investing.com/commodities/gold-historical-data

•             https://www.investing.com/commodities/silver-historical-data

 

and store them locally (in a file or database, as you see fit).


2. Please then write a program that takes the following 3 command line arguments:

•             Start date (in the format 2017-05-10)

•             End date (in the format 2017-05-22)

•             Commodity type (either "gold" or silver”)

Then first describe the statistical properties of the data. Next, tell whether the data are stationary. Lastly, provide additional time series properties of interest, if any.


3. Write a program to predict the price of the next 4 days. This program should internally use at least 2 forecasting models where the performance is evaluated. Please write up an explanation of how you judged the performance of the models and selected the best model.
